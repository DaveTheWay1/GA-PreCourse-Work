        <!-- The <ul> tag in the parent element stands for unordered list, which is a list of things in no particular order. -->
        <li>Orge Blood Ballad</li>
        <!-- The <li> in the child elements stands for list item. Each item gets its own set of <li> tags, which ensures that each item is listed on a separate line. -->
        <li>Love is Weird</li>
        <li>Just Because</li>
        <li>Darkness in the Dark</li>

    <!-- This is one of several “self-closing” HTML tags. It closes itself when we add a /> at the end of a statement. -->
    <!-- src stands for source, as in where the image comes from. This is usually a URL. -->
    <!-- The alt stands for alternative text, commonly called “alt text.” appears for any reason that your img doesnt appear -->
    <!-- the image’s width and height in pixels. The original image was much too large (2592x1936), so you reduced it proportionally. You can add these in the HTML tag, like we did here, or in your CSS, which we’ll learn about in a future lesson. -->

<!-- The a in the tag stands for anchor. An anchor tag is a means of linking to another place; either to a location on the same page or to a completely different website, like you’re doing here.
The href stands for hypertext reference. This is the web address to which you are linking.
The target attribute is a finishing touch. It isn’t strictly necessary, but it’s good to include. Setting the target value to “_blank” tells the browser to open the destination page in a new window or tab. If we don’t include a target element, when a user clicks on the link, the new site will open in the same window (and take them away from our page). We don’t want that!
After the target, you can enter the display text, which the user will see on the page (instead of the long, messy hyperlink). -->

<!-- What’s the opposite of an unordered list? An ordered list! Numbered lists that follow a specific order use a different tag — <ol> — that behaves similarly to how a <ul> does. -->
